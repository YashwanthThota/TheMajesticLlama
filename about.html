            Hi all!! This is Yashwanth Thota from India. I'm currently living in Arlington,Texas and pursuing my master's in computer Sciences at The Univerity of Texas at Arlington(expected december 2018).

        <h1>My Fascination Towards Front End development</h1>

        <p>
          My interest towards web development had started since my childhood. When I came accross a website for the first time, I was thrilled and amazed by looking at it. At that situation, A question "How the websites were made?" ran through my mind and later that question turned into curiosity.
          That's why I chose to do my undergradution in computer science and engineering back in India. It all started with some basic websites and now with the kind of front end development skills I possess, I am really happy and satisfied to know my dream came true. With the introduction of Html5 in 2014 the
          website development had been streamlined and became interoperable. I am glad to be familiar with the front end technologies like Html5, CSS, JavaScript which are the backbone of website development. Finally I am waiting for a chance to prove myself and hope that I will make it to Zappo.com.
        </p>
        <h1> Technical Decisions </h1>
        <li> Have used HTML5, CSS3, Javascript to develop this website</li>
        <li> This website has been made mobile friendly taking into the consideration of the number of mobile   users</li>
        <li> I have choose to go for formal website as Zappos.com is an online store it have to be formal interms of color, textfont and alignments</li>
        <li> The alignments, colors, textfont were developed by using CSS3 and the Skeleton website was developed using HTML5</li>
        <li> As the online store should have the feature of picture enlargement of the goods. I have incorporated this feature for the gallery pictures by using JavaScript</li>
        <li> The website should show both warning messages like "please select the number of items", success messages like "order has been placed". The email subscription shows up a popup window, this is incorporated by using javascript</li>
        <li> Some items will have videos which features that items like clothes, shoes which have to be imported from other sites. This is the reason to incorporate youtube video into the site.</li>
        <li> Finally, the website will definitely have dynamic content. This is the reason to incorporate the Llama Game, This is done by using Javascript</li>
