          <li>The height of a full-grown, full-size llama is <b>1.7</b> to <b>1.8 m (5.6 to 5.9 ft)</b> tall at the top of the head, and can weigh between <b>130</b> and <b>200 kg (290 and 440 lb)</b></li>
          <li> At birth, a baby llama (called a <b>cria</b>) can weigh between <b>9</b> and <b>14 kg (20 and 31 lb)</b>. Llamas typically live for <b>15</b> to <b>25 years</b>, with some individuals surviving <b>30 years or more</b>.</li>
           <li>They are very social animals and live with other llamas as a <b>herd</b>.</li>
           <li>The name <b>llama</b> (in the past also spelled <b>'lama'</b> or <b>'glama'</b>) was adopted by European settlers from native Peruvians.</li>
           <li>The wool produced by a llama is <b>very soft</b> and <b>lanolin-free</b></li>
           <li>Llamas appear to have originated from the <b>central plains of North America</b> about <b>40 million years ago</b>. They migrated to <b>South America</b> <b>about three million years ago</b> during the <b>Great American Interchange</b>. By the end of the last ice age (10,000â€“12,000 years ago), camelids were extinct in North America.</li>
           <li><b>As of 2007</b>, there were over seven million llamas and alpacas in South America, and due to importation from South America in the late 20th century, there are now over <b>158,000 llamas</b> and <b>100,000 alpacas</b> in the United States and Canada.</li>
